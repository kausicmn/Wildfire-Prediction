# Wildfire-Prediction

Wildfires are both difficult to predict and fight because each wildfire is unique to the place where
it occurs. The combinations of various climatic factors such as dry vegetation, fog, gusty wind,
rainfall,etc., further aggravates the situation. With so much impact on social and economic
factors, it becomes necessary to build a near real-time solution for predicting and controlling
wildfires. Therefore, we are building a wildfire prediction model to predict whether the wildfire
will occur or not based on fire data and weather data of California for year 2020.

# Objectives

Our goal is to create a model to analyse the influence of external weather factors and elevation
on wildfire occurrence as well as analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of wildfire
occurrence to predict whether the wildfire will occur or not.
